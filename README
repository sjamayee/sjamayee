It does not do anything yet!

What it should do:

Sjamayee is a data browser, explorer and object composer.
It should give quick access to all your data in a dynamic grid.

All data is viewed in one grid, without scrollbars, for fast navigation with navigation-keys/mousewheel.
Could be used as another view on the data of a lot of products like Drupal, Salesforce.com, Sap, Documentum and
all other products for which we write a sjamayee scrambler and dataservices.
Helps in data navigation and does not change your data in any way.
Shows all data in a where-used/what-used structure and remembers the navigation path.
Completely written in javascript and extendable with webservices.
Can be used as an alternative console application, evt. for cross-platform (like Salesforce.com, SAP, Documentum, ...).

Publishing/combining databases/files to the intranet/internet and thereby using added functionality, like Google AJAX Language API.

Using Yahoo Pipes for adding webcontent.

Some characteristics:
- a dynamic grid (default/setting: -25/+15 columns 10/20 rows).
- parent/child/root.
- every cell (parent/child) can become the new ROOT for a new navigation (-25/0/+15).
- fast to leftmost column (HOME) and to the rightmost column (END).
- CRUD on objects and relations/references with UNDO/REDO.
- MODEL and DATA environments.
- MODEL for defining model objects/references with their generator texts.
- DATA for the end-user environment.
- in MODEL and DATA there's a list with all objects and grid with all references between the objects.
- polymorphic browsing ex. resource->employee->manager->CTO.
- in each class an object exposes the appropriate/specific relations/references. 
- generator for text generation from the model/data texts.
- scrambler module for capturing data in the sjamayee model.
- scrambler can be standard for some generic uses like Drupal (menus,taxonomy,fields/CCK).
- specific uses need specific scramblers.   

Goal:

1. fast data access.
2. simple user interface, no scrollbars.
3. always a where-used/what-used view.
4. extending with a graphical canvas.
5. full javascript = responsive user interface.
6. integrating data from all sources with web content.
7. all data from different sources combined in one single grid.
8. same interface on small devices (like smartphone/2 columns).
9. mashup the data with lots of internet functionality (like Google/Translate, Yahoo/pipes, XAOP/Streamtails).
10. creating a layer/bridge on top of great products like (Drupal,Salesforce,SAP,Documentum,Oracle).
11. creating a standard component for easy re-use and extension.
12. creating another view on the same data.
13. and next ... sjamayee-composer: "A real component builder."

New/Other Goal: The same simple interface on all data sources, like:

1. sjamayee4drupal / Sjamayee on Drupal: A view on all Drupals and their dynamic content.
2. sjamayee4sfdc   / Sjamayee on Salesforce: A view/console for Salesforce.com.
3. sjamayee4git    / Sjamayee on Git: A view on Git (repositories).
4. sjamayee4db     / Sjamayee on MySql, Oracle, ... (database).
5. sjamayee4sap    / Sjamayee on SAP, Documentum and others.
5. sjamayee4ppp    / Sjamayee on the Semantic Web (RDF) ...
